# Ved_Nigam_Portfolio
## A portfolio of interesting and industry-relevant projects I have worked on throughout my college and professional career.

## Bizhacks Hackathon
### The prompt for this Hackathon was the advent of AI, specifically how Artificial Intelligence may be able to affect the return on investment of products/services made my mankind. Is this going to be a resource or something that will change the footprint of mankind severely?

## Introduction to Machine Learning Portfolio
### This is a collection of an application of all significant topics we covered in the introductory Machine Learning class at the University of Texas at Dallas.

## Image Classification on Balls Dataset
### The development of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify a given ball as a type of ball. The model can handle 30 different types of balls with 90%+ accuracy.

## Statistical Learning on Yearly Retail Walmart Sales 
### Worked in a group to identify shopping trends throughout years of Walmart Retail sales. There is a lot of future scope in this dataset. Something I am particularly interested is how Walmarts in different regions of the United States may affect sales differently than other regions during the same time of the year.

## Hospital Database and Connected Website
### This is another group project that I was a significant part of. I coordinated and designed many ideas that were implemented in this project. The database is hosted on a local MySQL server and is connected to a Flask, Python website. There are several SQL scripts that will help you get specific information on the various parts of this hypothetical hospital.
