# Outline for installation requirements/prior knowledge to use this hospital database
## Tools needed on the computer
- local MySQL server
- Python3
- Flask
- MySQL Workbench

## Steps
1. Expand the "hospital_db" dump using Workbench so the database is on the local computer. The application will access this database using credentials coded in the Python app.
2. Pull the code and make sure all required libraries are downloaded. "pip" was used to download all libraries.
3. If using VSCode, go to the "main.py" file of the "appCode" and and use the play button to run the application. This will render the app on the system's default browser.
4. You can also go into the directory of "appCode" and run "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" depending on the command line configurations of your computer.
5. Access the database using Workbench or the Command Line tools to get a username and password to log in to the app.
6. All parts of the application should be visible now!
